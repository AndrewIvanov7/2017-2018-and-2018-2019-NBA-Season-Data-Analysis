# 2017-2018-and-2018-2019-NBA-Season-Data-Analysis
Using the nbastatR package in R, I examined the performance of superstar players in the regular season and the playoffs. A majority of players who performed well in regular season saw a decline in efficiency and points per game in the playoffs. There was one player each season who saw an increase in efficiency and points per game in the postseason, and both players reached the NBA finals that year. In the 2017-2018 season, LeBron James averaged 34 points per game in the playoffs and 27.5 in the regular season. In the 2018-2019 season, Kawhi Leonard averaged 30.5 points per game in the playoffs and had an efficiency rating of 32. During the regular season he averaged 26.6 points per game and his efficiency was 26.
